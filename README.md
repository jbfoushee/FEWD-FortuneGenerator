# Front-End Web Development Final Project
## Fortune Generator

Let's face it: Opening a fortune cookie to get to the fortune is so analog.
We need a way to get to the fortune faster. And, if we don't like the fortune
we receive, we should be able to generate alternatives until satisfied.

The following website does just that.
Using features such as 
- JavaScript arrays and 
- mathematical functions, 
we can create infinite and alternative storylines that take the guesswork out
of the future!
